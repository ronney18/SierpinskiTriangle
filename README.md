# SierpinskiTriangle
This program creates a fractal design where it creates triangles recursively from the bottom to up, left and right. 
This design also changes color as the depth gets narrower. The constructor for this triangle calls itself until the depth hits zero. 
To run this program you must type "./Sierpinski [window size][depth]" on the command line.
